# TODO:
# - test the least respoonse time policy and figure out how to get number of active connections to a container
# - build the resoruce based policy
#   - add constraints on the containers and determine their current usage to choose the next best container
# - testing of above policies for the correctness
# - determine the metric to measure the performance and cost w.r.t. the different workloads
#   - check performance with and without the load balancer
# - auto-scaling the containers
# - generate the different behaviors of workload to test
